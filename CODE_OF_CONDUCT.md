# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, irrelevant arrests or convictions, nationality, personal
appearance, marital or relationship status, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Make a good effort to communicate clearly using proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Participating in hateful or offensive forums
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Recommended behavior (these are simply recommendations; entities will not be pressured into following these guidelines)

Entities are encouraged to use their real names and identities. Anonymous users are more likely to misbehave, and all actions taken by anonymous entities will be viewed with suspicion.

Entities are encouraged to sign their statements with their Circcash private keys using their Circcash wallets.

Entities are encouraged to understand and be interested in topics such as cryptocurrency technologies, cryptography, and reversible computation according to their abilities. 

## Banned entities

Due to unprofessionalism and/or the promotion of violence, all entities who have ever enrolled in CUNY, SUNY, or Notre Dame University (or any other academic institution openly caught promoting violence) are banned from participating in the development of Circcash.

All entities who have ever been affiliated with an institution with a Bio-Safety level 4 laboratory (such as Boston University) is banned from participating in the development of Circcash. This ban may be lifted once the BSL-4 labs implement Circcash's protocol for bio-safety.

All entities who are currently affiliated with a college or university are banned from participating in the development of Circcash. Furthermore, we refuse to recognize any degree/position from/at any college or university since these academic institutions promote violence.

Academic institutions that have been openly caught promoting violence include Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Pennsylvania.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at circcash9192020@protonmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
